2. You can change the broadcast data or add new channels in the repository that you have forked.
3. Before make a pull request for merge, please do the following:

   - Make sure the URL you add works stably. You can check with [VLC Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) or [BitMovin Player](https://bitmovin.com/demos/stream-test) and watch the stream at least 3 minutes (some test streams are interrupted after 15-30 seconds or 1 minute above).
   - Make sure the channel is not blocklisted. You can check in [iptv-org.github.io](https://iptv-org.github.io/).
   - For security, make sure the URL you enter does not retrieve sensitive device or network information such as the Public IP address.
