## Important notice for Indonesian-IPTV users

### English Version

I discovered that my IPTV service was being sold on the S*opee marketplace for Rp.20.000 (US$1.2). Starting with the next update, I will implement a signed URL system, session expiration, and users will have to go through a URL shortener that has advertisements before getting the playlist data for security reasons.

Thanks.

### Versi Bahasa Indonesia

Saya menemukan bahwa layanan IPTV milik saya dijual di marketplace S*opee dengan harga Rp. 20.000. Mulai pembaruan selanjutnya, saya akan akan menetapkan sistem URL yang ditandatangani, sesi expired, dan user harus melewati URL Shortener yang memiliki iklan sebelum mendapatkan data playlist untuk alasan keamanan.

Terima kasih.
